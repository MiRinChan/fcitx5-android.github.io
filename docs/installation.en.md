# Installation

You can download the latest build from [Jenkins](https://jenkins.fcitx-im.org/job/android/job/fcitx5-android/). There is an [Updater](#_2) to download and manage the installation as well.

## Updater

`fcitx5-android-updater` is an independent app, which downloads and installs the apk from Jenkins.
So far, the updater is work in progress, so it's not built and distributed in Jenkins.
You can obtain the source code of the updater at <https://github.com/fcitx5-android/fcitx5-android-updater> to build and install it manually.

    A developer build is available in our [Telegram group](index.md).
